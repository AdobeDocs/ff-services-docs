- [Rendition API](src/pages/indesign/api/rendition.md) -  Creates renditions of a file in either PNG, JPG, or PDF format.
- [Custom Capabilities API](src/pages/indesign/api/capabilities.md) - Perform almost any InDesign task using a custom script. With this API you can submit and execute custom capabilites, and check the latest status of an executed script.
