## Docs issues or feedback?

Feedback is essential for perfecting our docs and our users are our most valued voices.
There are a few ways to bring doc bugs to our attention.
Reach out with any edits, suggestions, or feedback.

All documentation feedback is welcome here. For technical support and software feedback, submit in [our community forums for Firefly](https://community.adobe.com/t5/adobe-firefly/ct-p/ct-adobe-firefly?page=1&sort=latest_replies&filter=all&lang=all&tabid=bugs).

## Submit on the page

Use the button at the top of most document pages to file an issue directly to the site account in Github.
The approved committers and owners on these repos work to reach consensus around project direction and offer solutions within issue threads (when appropriate).
