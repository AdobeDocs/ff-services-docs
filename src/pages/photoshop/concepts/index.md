## Layers and Target Layer

You use layers in Photoshop to stack different parts of an image. Each layer is like a sheet of transparent glass where you can add photos, paint on it, or add vectors. When you stack layers, you can see parts of the image below if an parts of an upper layer are still transparent. Layers isolate each part of an image so you can independently perform image enhancement to one particular. For example, you can view each layer here in the Layers Panel in the Photoshop app:

If you only choose to view one layer, such as the moon in the image, you see this:
