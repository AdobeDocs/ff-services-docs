## Overview

This documentation provides instructions for Adobe Firefly API. Firefly is the natural extension of the technology Adobe has produced over the past 40 years, driven by the belief that people should be empowered to bring their ideas into the world precisely as they imagine them.

With Firefly, you can ideate, create, and communicate while significantly improving creative workflows using generative AI. You might have already tried out the Firefly web app, along with features powered by Firefly in Adobe’s flagship apps and Adobe Stock. And now it is available to you as an API. Integrate them with your workflow as it suits your needs.
