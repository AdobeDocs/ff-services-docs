## Overview

This documentation provides instructions for the Adobe Firefly API. Firefly is the natural extension of the technology Adobe has produced over the past 40 years, driven by the belief that people should be empowered to bring their ideas into the world precisely as they imagine them. Note that Firefly API is under limited availability. Contact your Adobe representative to get access to the API.

Describe your creative vision in your own words and we will bring it to life, saving you time and effort. With Firefly, you can ideate, create, and communicate while significantly improving creative workflows using generative AI. You might have already tried out the Firefly web app, along with features powered by Firefly in Adobe's flagship apps and Adobe Stock. And now it is available to you as an API. Integrate them with your workflow as it suits your needs.
