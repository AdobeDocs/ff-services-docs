# Rate Limits

Adobe Firefly API places default rate limits on the volume and frequency of API calls. Contact your account manager to request higher rate limits if needed.

## Summary of Rate Limits

Our API imposes the following rate limits **per organization**:

* **4** requests **per minute (RPM)**
* **9,000** requests **per day (RPD)** (Relevant for those who have worked with their account manager to increase their rate limits beyond 4 RPM without changing this default daily limit.)

## What to Do If You Run Into Issues

If you exceed the rate limits, you'll receive an **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** error. If you encounter this error, consider any of the following solutions:

* Review your usage and reduce unnecessary requests.
* Implement retry logic via a [`retry-after` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) or an [exponential backoff strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).
* Contact your account manager to request enabling higher usage rates.

## Why do API rate limits exist?

Rate limits are standard practice that serve several important purposes, including:

* Preventing abuse: Protects APIs from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
* Protecting against downtime: Reduces the risk of service interruptions.
* Controlling costs: Helps manage resource consumption and associated expenses.
