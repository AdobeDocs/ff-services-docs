# Cursor Rules Location

Purpose: define how to create new Cursor rules in this repo.

## Quick checklist (LLM)

- [ ] File lives in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`
- [ ] Filename is kebab-case and ends with `.mdc`
- [ ] Frontmatter contains `description`, `globs` (optional), `alwaysApply`
- [ ] Rule has a clear title and concise instructions

## Where rules live

Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:

```text
.cursor/rules/
├── your-rule-name.mdc
├── another-rule.mdc
└── ...
```

Never place rule files:

- In the project root
- In subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
- In any other location

## Naming conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Always use `.mdc` extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

## Rule file template

Each rule file follows this structure:

### Metadata section

````md
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting and establishing the context for the rule use-case.

Include a numbered list of use cases or functions the rule is intended to perform so users understand the agent's purpose and how to use it.

## Contents section

Organize concepts with headings and subheadings in this order:

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
````

## Content guidance (LLM)

- Prefer numbered steps for procedures and short bullets for constraints
- Keep examples minimal and directly tied to the rule
- Avoid duplicating guidance that exists in another rule file
